To help me narrow down the cause, could you tell me a little more about the problem? For example:\n\n*   **When did you start noticing the slowness?** Was it gradual or sudden?\n*   **What are you doing when it's slow?** Is it slow when you're browsing the internet, opening programs, or just generally all the time?\n*   **Have you installed any new software or hardware recently?**\n*   **What kind of computer is it?** (Windows, Mac, Desktop, Laptop)\n\nIn the meantime, here are a few basic things you can try:\n\n1.  **Close any programs you aren't using.** Too many programs running at once can bog down your system.\n2.  **Check your internet connection.** Sometimes a slow internet connection can make it seem like your computer is slow.\n3.  **Make sure you have enough free space on your hard drive.** If your hard drive is almost full, it can slow things down.\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of the situation, I can provide more specific advice."
